Group 1's study on COVID worldwide data

The aim of this project is to be able to:

1. Know the country that is most and least vaccinated

2. The progress of worldwide vaccination. Thus, the percentage of people worldwide that are fully vaccinated.

3. A breakdown of the most widely used vaccines by country.

4. A average of the most distributed/used drug vaccines worldwide

The datasets acquired were and used were:

1. country_vaccinations.csv - This contains the number of vaccinations, people fully vaccinated. Records taken were from 29th November, 2020 to 30 September, 2021.

2. 2021_population.csv - This data contains the 2021 population of the 221 countries used for this analysis

The country_vaccinations.csv folder was filtered out to obtain the total number of people vaccinated as at 30th September, 2021. This filtered dataset was then merged with the 2021 population dataset.

3. manufacturer_breakdown.csv - This data contains the manufacturer breakdown of COVID-19 vaccines used in 38 countries. This data was analysed to know the most widely used vaccine.

The datasets were used to answer the following questions:

Question 1
Which country's population is the most vaccinated?

Question 2
Which country's population is the least vaccinated?

Question 3
In considering the progess of vaccination as at 30th September, 2021, what percentage of the world's population have been fully vaccinated?

Question 4
Why does Gibraltor have more than 100% of its population vaccinated?

Question 5
Among the 38 countries, which country consumes which vaccine type the most?

Question 6
On the average, what is the most and least distributed/consumed drug?
